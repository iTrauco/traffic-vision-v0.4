## 🔄 Progress Tracking & Checkpoint System

The following cells implement simple progress tracking and checkpoint functionality to:

1. **Track Processing Progress**
   - Monitor which video is currently being processed
   - Count successful vs failed videos
   - Display elapsed time

2. **Enable Restart Capability**
   - Save progress after each video completes
   - Automatically skip already-processed videos on rerun
   - Maintain list of failed videos for retry

This ensures we don't lose work if the kernel crashes and provides visibility into long-running processes.

## 💾 Initialize Checkpoint and Progress Tracking Functions

This module establishes checkpoint and progress tracking capabilities for the preprocessing workflow. The system creates functions for saving and loading processing state, initializes timing and counting variables, recovers from any existing checkpoints, and provides real-time progress monitoring with completion status.

**Implemented below.**


```python
import json
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize tracking variables
CHECKPOINT_FILE = "preprocessing_checkpoint.json"
start_time = time.time()

def load_checkpoint():
    """Load previous progress if it exists"""
    if os.path.exists(CHECKPOINT_FILE):
        with open(CHECKPOINT_FILE, 'r') as f:
            checkpoint = json.load(f)
            print(f"✓ Loaded checkpoint: {len(checkpoint['processed'])} videos already processed")
            return checkpoint
    return {
        "processed": [], 
        "failed": [], 
        "last_completed": None, 
        "start_time": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }

def save_checkpoint(checkpoint):
    """Save current progress"""
    checkpoint['last_updated'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
    with open(CHECKPOINT_FILE, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(checkpoint, f, indent=2)

def log_progress(video_name, status, checkpoint, total_videos):
    """Log progress and update checkpoint"""
    if status == "success":
        checkpoint['processed'].append(video_name)
    else:
        checkpoint['failed'].append(video_name)
    
    checkpoint['last_completed'] = video_name
    save_checkpoint(checkpoint)
    
    # Display progress
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time
    processed_count = len(checkpoint['processed'])
    failed_count = len(checkpoint['failed'])
    
    print(f"\n[{datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')}] {video_name}: {status}")
    print(f"Progress: {processed_count}/{total_videos} | Failed: {failed_count} | Elapsed: {elapsed/60:.1f}min")

# Load any existing checkpoint
checkpoint = load_checkpoint()
print(f"Ready to process videos. Checkpoint system initialized.")
```
